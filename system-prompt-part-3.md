Now we have Car, Person and a better start/stop simulator, we are ready to do the next step - the "schedule". when the page is loaded, create a "stack" of cars and persons and give each car an arrivetime. Assume this store will have 80 cars arrive in the hour at random times between 0 and 45 minutes. display this stack to the left of the lot somehow with some indication of the time they'll arrive 

to the RIGHT, store a similar representation of the cars that have already arrived, shopped, and exited. let me mousehover over a car that's out and know information about the occupant

use some unicode character to indicate which cars are where. and color the cars appropriately if possible.
